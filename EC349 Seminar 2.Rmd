    Answer Below
Weaknesses

1. Outdated
2. Documentation heavy
3. Not a Project management approach

Addressing the weaknesses

1. Define team roles
2. Combine with a team coordination process
3. Document enough... but not too much

> 9.  Write and execute a code to randomly generate 10 numbers from a
>     normal distribution with mean 12 and standard deviation 3.

    Answer Below

```{r}
rnorm(10, mean = 12, sd = 3)
```

> 10. Write and execute a code to calculate the mean of 12 random
>     numbers generated from the intervalof integes from 5 to 25.

    Answer Below
```{r}
mean(sample(5:25, 12))
```


> 11. Write and execute a code to create a scatter plot containing 12
>     points whose coordinates were randomly geenrated in the interval 5
>     to 25. Provide a title for the figure, label the x and y axis.

    Answer Below
```{r}
x_coordinates <- sample(5:25,12)
y_coordinates <- sample(5:25,12)

plot(x_coordinates, y_coordinates,
     main = "Scatterplot",
     xlab = "X-axis",
     ylab = "Y-axis")
  
```

> 12. Write and execute a code to create a function to calculate
